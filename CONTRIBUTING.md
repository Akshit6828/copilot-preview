## Adding an item to the gallery

We have a [Gallery](gallery) of GitHub Copilot examples set up to show how it can be used. We hope that it's useful for newcomers to quickly level up and see some of the things it's capable of. Basic-to-advanced level examples in all supported languages are all welcome. 

To add a gallery example

* Simply create a sub-directory within the `gallery` directory named with the pattern `language-brief-description` and place the relevant content in there. E.g. [`ruby-twitter-api-example`](ruby-twitter-api-examplw).

* Create `README.md` file with details on what you're doing in the directory you created along with any code or supporting assets for your examples.

* GIFs and videos are welcome, but please keep the file sizes small.

We'll highlight some of our favorites on the [README](/gallery/README.md) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/github).

## Guidelines

* Please keep it SFW.
* Please avoid conflicts of interest - such as self-promotion of your product, library, etc.

If GitHub Copilot blew your mind and/or saved you a ton of time, that's a great example of something we'd love to see ❤️
